- Use logging for all programs.
- Allow command-line arguments when creating new programs.
- Follow Python best practices.
- Follow software development best practices.
- When creating a function, follow the single responsibility principle. Ensure the function is easy to test.
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes.
- Add type hints to all functions and classes when possible.
- testing framework: unittest
- Follow test naming standards. The name of your test should consist of three parts:
    - Name of the method being tested
    - Scenario under which the method is being tested
    - Expected behavior when the scenario is invoked
- each test function should follow this naming convention (camelCase for scenario and expected behaviour): `test_<method_name>_ScenarioOfMethodBeingTested_ExpectedBehaviour`.
